# Contributing

A minimal contribution requires the following steps:
- Add a directory under `llama-toolbox/` if your API isn't already listed.
- Add the class which extends `llama-toolbox/base_tool/BaseTool` in the directory.
- Make sure to fill out the definition method as well as the fn method.
- Add documentation in `docs/<your-api>/index.md` for your API.
- Add the function, with a link to your docs in the `ROADMAP.md` file.
